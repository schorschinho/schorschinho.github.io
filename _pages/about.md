The specfitlab is part of the [Neuroradiology Division in the Russell H. Morgan Department of Radiology and Radiological Science](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/radiology/specialties/neuroradiology/) at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, and the [F.M. Kirby Research Center for Functional Brain Imaging at Kennedy Krieger Institute](https://www.kennedykrieger.org/kirby-research-center).


Our research is dedicated to developing modern techniques to measure levels of important biochemicals in the living human brain using magnetic resonance spectroscopy. We are particularly interested in improving the detection of neurotransmitters (GABA, glutamate, aspartate), antioxidants (glutathione, ascorbate), and potential molecular markers of brain tumor mutations (2-hydroxyglutarate, cystathionine).


The techniques we develop are used to investigate the neurochemical confounds in a wide range of neurological and psychiatric disorders. Currently, we study the levels of brain metabolites in patients with mild cognitive impairment. Further research projects we are involved in concern various neurodevelopmental disorders (autism spectrum disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, Touretteâ€™s syndrome), tuberous sclerosis, hepatic encephalopathy, and glioma.

A major focus of our attention is the standardization of data acquisition and analysis. We are actively developing the [modular open-source analysis software Osprey](/projects/project-osprey/), and glad to modify it to support your particular acquisition technique.

We believe that the magnetic resonance spectroscopy community can reap great benefit from sharing code and data, standardizing our acquisition, and streamlining our pipelines for processing, quantifying, and interpreting spectroscopic data. In line with our drive to facilitate exchange and transparency, we have supported the creation of the [MRSHub](https://mrshub.org), a comprehensive resource of code and data for MRS researchers. We further actively contribute to the mission of the [Committee for Code & Data Sharing](https://mrshub.org/about_committee/), a permanent sub-committee of the ISMRM MR Spectroscopy Study Group.
