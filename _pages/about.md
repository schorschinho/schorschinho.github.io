The specfitlab is part of the <a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/radiology/specialties/neuroradiology/">Neuroradiology Division</a> in the <a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/radiology/">Russell H. Morgan Department of Radiology and Radiological Science</a> at <a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/">Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine</a>, and the <a href="https://www.kennedykrieger.org/kirby-research-center">F.M. Kirby Research Center for Functional Brain Imaging</a> at the <a href="https://www.kennedykrieger.org/">Kennedy Krieger Institute</a>.


Our research is dedicated to developing modern techniques to measure levels of important biochemicals in the living human brain using magnetic resonance spectroscopy. We are particularly focused on improving the detection of neurotransmitters (GABA, glutamate, aspartate), antioxidants (glutathione, ascorbate), and potential molecular markers of brain tumor mutations (2-hydroxyglutarate, cystathionine).


The techniques we develop are used to investigate the neurochemical confounds in a wide range of neurological and psychiatric disorders. Currently, we study the levels of brain metabolites in patients with mild cognitive impairment. Further research projects we are involved in concern various neurodevelopmental disorders (autism spectrum disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, Touretteâ€™s syndrome), tuberous sclerosis, hepatic encephalopathy, and glioma.


A recent major focus of our attention is the standardization of data acquisition and analysis. We believe that the magnetic resonance spectroscopy community can reap great benefit from embracing the practices of the Open Science movement: We need to adapt code sharing, standardize our acquisition, and streamline our pipelines for processing, quantifying, and interpreting spectroscopic data.
