  description: "I grew up in a quiet town in the Rhineland, Germany, and studied physics at Heinrich-Heine-Universität in Düsseldorf (despite spending my formative years dreaming about becoming a paleontologist due to an early love for dinosaurs). After graduation, I went on to staff the media department at Fortuna Düsseldorf for a year, fulfilling a career dream of working in sports journalism, before re-discovering that I wanted to be a scientist after all.


  Fortunately, I found an opportunity to do a PhD with Prof. Alfons Schnitzler at the Institute of Clinical Neuroscience and Medical Psychology at the University Hospital in Düsseldorf, before moving to Johns Hopkins University for a postdoctoral fellowship with my Richard Edden and Peter Barker. Five years later, I am still in Baltimore, utterly thankful for all the wonderful serendipity and exceptional mentorship that brought me to this place and this position.


  My primary interest is to create an environment in which my team and I can enjoy working on interesting research questions and building useful tools, while supporting and encouraging each other's personal and professional growth.


In my free time, I still spend a questionable amount of time watching, reading, and thinking about football (the variety played with your feet). I love getting around Baltimore and its beautiful surroundings on my roadbike. Weekends frequently feature coffee, podcasts, Spotify playlists, cooking, reading, and meeting friends in nice green or water-adjacent places around town. Finally, I consider myself an enthusiastic and passionate, but hopelessly pathetic amateur woodworker."

  description: "My interest in MR was awoken by stumbling upon a brochure of a newly established study program 'Medical Physics' in Düsseldorf with intriguing pictures of whole-body MRI scans and the idea of studying the advancing field of medical research. During my undergrad years, I was introduced to MR spectroscopy and quantitative imaging under supervision of Prof. Hans-Jörg Wittsack and Georg Oeltzschner at the Institute of Diagnostic and Interventional Radiology at the University Hospital Düsseldorf.

  Luckily, I was introduced to Prof. Alfons Schnitzler, who gave me an opportunity to do a PhD about metabolic imaging and spectroscopy in hepatic encephalopathy at the Institute of Clinical Neuroscience and Medical Psychology. After finishing my PhD in 2019, I've started my postdoctoral fellowship at Johns Hopkins University, working together with Richard Edden, Georg Oeltzschner, and Peter Barker.

  My research as postdoctoral fellow is focused on the detection of brain metabolites using conventional and edited magnetic resonance spectroscopy, as well as spectroscopic imaging. My particular interest is to develop and standardize methods to detect low-concentration metabolites, such as the main inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA, ascorbate, glutamine, and glutathione.

  Recently I have worked together with Georg Oeltzschner on the development of the open-source MRS data analysis toolbox Osprey. This project is focused on the standardization of processing and quantification of MRS data, as well as investigating the performance of the underlying algorithms to better understand the modelling process. During this effort I did also develop an R-based open-source toolbox for transparent data visualization [SpecVis](https://github.com/HJZollner/SpecVis).

  When I'm not coding, I'm an outspoken podcast- and coffee-junkie. Pre-pandemic activities included visiting concerts and festivals with friends and occasional rock climbing, recently replaced with increasing passion for cooking."
